<p>Cell line XYZ was harvested from a T:75cm<sup>2</sup> flask into a final volume of 10 ml of media (protocol linked in the Methods section above).</p>
<p>A cell count was performed using the BioRad&nbsp;<span style="color: #0000ff;">TC-10</span> cell counter and cells resuspended to a final volume of 12 ml at a concentration of 1e5 cells/ml in standard media containing 10% FCS.</p>
<p>100 &micro;l of this suspension was then plated into each well of a 96-well plate using a multichannel pipette.</p>
<p>Plates of cells were incubated at 37&ordm;C overnight with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
