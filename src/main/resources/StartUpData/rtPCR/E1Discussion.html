<p>The primer set to test the female-specific promoter did not work, however primers to test exons 5, 9, and 17 show striking female-biased expression, which supports the existence of a female-specific promoter.</p>
<p>E19-18 shows a faint band but it seems to be the wrong size. order a new primer set to test this.</p>

<p>Exon 18 does not show strong male-biased expression. There is a faint band of the correct size for exon 3-27. Ramp up cycle number to confirm.</p>
