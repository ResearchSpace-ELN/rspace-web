<p><em>bam</em> mutant female and male cDNA made on: 5/16/13 &nbsp; from RNA made on: 5/15/13</p>
<p>tubes #: 1-4</p>
<p>I am extracting RNA from male and female <em>bam </em>mutant
Drosophila gonads, reverse transcribing to cDNA, and perfoming pcr on plus and minus reverse transcriptase
samples of the resultant set of cDNA using primers that amplify products across exon-exon boundaries.
In this way I can identify sex specific transcripts and therefore sex-specific splicing.</p>
