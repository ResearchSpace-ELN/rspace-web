<p><strong>Experiment: check total protein levels of ADI in infected cells by Western Blot.</strong></p>
<p>Last week's infection experiment looked nice on FACS. Haven't used the antibodies on natural infections before. Assume the protein levels will be a quite a bit lower in natural infections compared to my over expressing cells - need to confirm a good primary antibody concentration. Also, the secondary antibody is a new batch but I'll use 1:2000 as before.</p>
<p>Sample preparation:</p>
<p>Cells from last week's infection (1 ml cell sup, spun down at 7000rpm, supernatant taken off, stored in -80 freezer) were resuspended in 1x SDS-loading buffer without dye. Boil samples for 5 minutes in heat block. Take out 5 &micro;l for protein concentration measurement.</p>
<p>Bradford assay: Make BSA dilutions from 10 mg/ml stock with 1x loading buffer (1mg/ml, 0,8mg/ml, 0,6mg/ml, 0,4 mg/ml, 0.2 mg/ml, 0 mg/ml=blank). Filter a new 50 mL aliquote of the bradford solution through a 3mm watman filter paper folded in a funnel. Use 1ml bradford solution per 5 &micro;l sample. Make standard curve in excel. <br /> -&gt; sample concentration is 2.9mg/ml = 2.9&micro;g/&micro;l. For western should use 20-30 &micro;g per well, need 3 wells + coomassie gel too. -&gt; use 10 &micro;l per well, plus dye also in 1x loading buffer = 12 &micro;l to load per well x 4 = 40 ul sample, 8 ul dye. Take excess to total 60 &micro;l to be on the safe side (50 ul sample, 10 ul dye) and boil 5 min.</p>
<p>Use NuPage Gel in 1X MOPS buffer.</p>
<p>Load prestained marker Dual Color, in first and last lane. Load uninfected sample (see last week for preparations) in next lane and then the infected samples.</p>
<p>Separate as recomended at 200V, after 15 minutes turned down to 60mA as gel started smiling. Next time start at 150 V and increase to 200V.</p>
<p>At clear separations of 190, 50 and 25 kDa bands, stopped gel separation. Still about 1 cm left of gel. Cut off 1 marker and next to lanes for Coomassie staining (use the microwave quick stain).</p>
<p>Transfer remaining marker plus lanes to a PVDF membrane by dry blotting, 7 min, exactly as in machine manual for iBlot Gel Transfer.</p>
<p>Aftedr transfer, cut membrane into strips. Mark for wells and gel position after transfer (cut lower right corner, label 1-6 with pencil)</p>
<p>Make up 5% milk- 0,1% tween - PBS block. Place each strip in 15 ml Falcon, add sufficient block and turn over end in rotator 1hr, at room temp.</p>
<p>Take off block and add primary antibody:</p>
<p>Dilute primary mouse anti-ADI in block buffer to 1:300, then dilute that 2/3 and 1/3. Make enough for 1 ml per strip. Incubate at 4 C over night.</p>
<p>Routine work: Split cells. Looked a bit lower than usual. Split 1:5 instead of 1:6. Setup one culture flask and use the rest for setting up 4 new 6 well plates for new infection on Wednesday. Heat-inactivated and aliquoted new batch of sera.</p>
