<p>Lane 1: uninfected sample 1:300, Lane 2: infected 1:300, Lane 3: 1:600, Lane 4: 1:900<p>

<p>Conclusion: Can definitely detect protein induction after infection! Lots of background as
always obviously, but can definitely see a nice specific band if using 1:300. Shouldn't go much
lower at least. Might be able to save some if optimizing both primary and secondary in comparison,
but not really necessary. Great stuff, can now continue looking at the different challenge groups.<p>

<p>Continuation from 31/1: Continue to analyze the flow data from last week infection.
Will continue tomorrow and pull out the numbers and do stats. The cell cycle data is really
clear for the aph and tub treatment, but the surface staining doesn't seem to have worked.
It did work in the das cells but their PI staining isn't as nice and clear as the treated groups.
Include all stains if enough cells tomorrow.<p>

<p>Infection levels: Stain 1: Gate on live cells. Mp1 on FITC here!<p>
