## This is an example CSV file defining list of users, groups and communities for RSpace batch registration.
## 
## Notes on syntax:
## 1. A line stating with double hash character (##) is a comment, and is skipped by CSV parser
## 2. A line starting with single hash character (#) is a command, and changes the way CSV parser treats following lines
## 3. Any other non-blank line is interpreted as a comma separated data line. Its interpretation depends on last seen command
## 4. Blank lines are ignored.
## 
## Users part should start with #Users command.
##
##  Each data line should contain 6 comma separated fields:  
##  First Name, Last Name, Email, Role, Username, Password
## 
##  If 'Role' field is empty then ROLE_USER will be assigned. You can choose from 4 roles:
##  ROLE_USER, ROLE_PI, ROLE_ADMIN (this is a Community admin), and ROLE_SYSADMIN.

##  if 'Username' field is empty RSpace will generate username based on First Name and Last Name
##  There are certain restrictions on the syntax of individual field:
##     - If supplied, usernames should be at least 6 alphanumeric characters
##     - If supplied, passwords must be at least 8 characters.
