- This documents describes RSpace custom changes to tinyMCE files -
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. 'table' plugin 
   (info updated for tinymce 5)

    /plugins/table/plugin.js is edited so it allows for creating tables by either 
	clicking on Grid ('Table' option) or by specifying explicit row and column 
	numbers ('Insert Table' option), or creating calculations table ('Insert Calculations Table').
	
	a) As the top level 'Table' dropdown is now constructed inside tinymceRS_configuration,
	a change required to plugin code is to 'Table' toolbar button construction.
	In line 9099 there is a following function creating the button: 

	var addButtons = function (editor, selectionTargets) {
      editor.ui.registry.addMenuButton('table', {
        tooltip: 'Table',
        icon: 'table',
        fetch: function (callback) {
          return callback('inserttable | cell row column | advtablesort | tableprops deletetable');
        }
      });
	
	It's enought to change fetch return method to include inserttabledialog and optHandsontable elements, so it should look like:
	
	return callback('inserttable inserttabledialog optHandsontable | cell row column | advtablesort | tableprops deletetable');

  b) Change the label of the "Insert table" in the context menu to "Insert Advanced Table". 
  c) Change the label "Table" to "Insert Table" 
2. 'codesample' plugin. 

 a) Replaced part of codesample plugin.js with /scripts/prism/prism.js library. That's because 
    tinyMCE version supports only default subset of languages, while we've added some more 
    (see RSPAC-1231).
    
    That seems quite safe, because tinyMCE plugin itselfs just wraps a prism.js file.
    The replaced part starts after line 116:
    // ------------------ Start wrap
    
    And ends at line 1402:
    // ------------------ End wrap
    
    FIXME: that was skipped during 4.7.9 upgrade, as the format of the plugin changed and it's 
    not obvious how to make a replacement. That means for additional languages the code 
    highlighting doesn't work inside tinyMCE (but seems to work in document view mode).
    
 b) re-title codesample plugin toolbar button so it says 'Insert code sample'.
    
3. 'link' plugin has menu/button texts changed to 'External Link'/'Insert external link'.

4. 'fontselect' and 'fontsizeselect' buttons were changed: 'fixedWidth: true' attribute was removed,
  so the buttons don't take more than necessary space on the toolbar. These buttons are created inside
  theme.js file, so search and replace that file (and theme.min.js) on update. (for modern theme, not mobile or inlite)
  
5. 'fullscreen' toolbar button has the label changed to 'Fullscreen editing' within Fullscreen pluggin

6. Include the codesample prism files (Google for the generator)

7. Take the latest symbols from charmap (an object) and replace the existing one in ui/src/tinyMCE/shortcutsPlugin/config.js

8. Make the max-height of tinyMCE dialog be 100vh so that their header and footer is always visible (on smaller devices)
============

When editing the plugins don't forget to replace content in plugin.min.js, as that's the file which is actually used.
Either the changed plugin.min.js need to be regenerated, with added comment pointing to plugin.js file location 
(as it's modified LGPL code), or alternatively plugin.min.js may be replaced with non-minified version.
