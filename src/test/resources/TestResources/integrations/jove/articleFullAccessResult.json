Preparation of the Carrier</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Preparation of DNA templates for in vitro transcription</strong>\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li>Prepare the PCR mix for each PCR template by combining 41 &#181;L of water, 20 &#181;L of 5x HF buffer, 8 &#181;L of 2.5 mM dNTPs, 10 &#181;L of 10 &#181;M unique forward primer (PCR_GN5_f1, <strong>Table 2</strong>; primers are dissolved and diluted in water), 10 &#181;L of 2 ng/&#181;L template plasmid containing the synthetic carrier gene and 1 &#181;L Phusion polymerase. Mix the PCR mix by pipetting. A master mix for all 10 templates can be prepared at once (prepare for 11 reactions).</li>\n\t\t<li>Add 90 &#181;L of the PCR mix to 10 &#181;L of each 10 &#181;M reverse primer (PCR_N6_r1-r10, <strong>Table 2</strong>). Mix by pipetting.</li>\n\t\t<li>PCR amplify the templates using the following program: 98 &#176;C for 60 s, (98 &#176;C for 10 s, 50 &#176;C for 30 s, 72 &#176;C for 30 s) 35 cycles, 72 &#176;C for 10 min, hold at 4 &#176;C.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Gel purification of PCR-amplified DNA templates</strong>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li>Prepare a 1% agarose gel (low-melting agarose is recommended).</li>\n\t\t\t<li>To decrease the volume, concentrate the PCR reaction mixtures from 100 &#181;L to 20 &#181;L total volume using the vacuum concentrator at a low-medium temperature (30&#8211;40 &#176;C).</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Add 6 &#181;L of the 6x loading dye, mix well, and load on the gel. Run electrophoresis for 30 min in 1x TAE buffer at the voltage appropriate for the used electrophoresis tank (5&#8211;10 V/cm). In parallel run a 100 bp or 1,000 bp DNA ladder.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Using a clean scalpel, excise the gel slices containing the target PCR product. Avoid excess agarose gel. Purify the PCR products using a gel extraction kit (according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions).<br />\n\t\t\t<strong>NOTE: </strong>A260/A230 ratios of DNA isolated from agarose gels are typically low (0.1&#8211;0.3). Expected target product and side products are shown in <strong class=\"xfig\">Figure 2A</strong>. Expected yields from 100 &#181;L PCR reactions are 1.2&#8211;3 &#181;g. Reactions can be scaled up to get a higher yield.</li>\n\t\t</ol>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>In vitro transcription of carrier molecules</strong>\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li>Transcribe carrier RNA in vitro using the T7 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Set up 10&#8211;20 &#181;L reactions (the recommended kit is in <strong>Table of Materials</strong>).</li>\n\t\t<li>Purify the in vitro transcribed RNA using an RNA purification kit. Set up DNA digestion in solution using DNase I following the manufacturer&#8217;s standard instructions, and elute the RNA in 50 &#181;L of water. To increase the elution yield, leave the water in the column for 5 min before centrifugation.<br />\n\t\t<strong>NOTE:</strong> Be careful not to exceed the maximum binding capacity of the columns (in the kit mentioned in the <strong>Table of Materials</strong>, capacity is up to 100 &#181;g). The expected yield from PCR templates 1&#8211;10 (1 kbp to 200 bp in length) is 25&#8211;50 &#181;g from 10 &#181;L in vitro transcription reactions. Reactions can be scaled up to get a larger stock of carrier molecules.</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Capping of in vitro transcribed carrier RNA molecules</strong>\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li>Prepare the capping mix by combining 2 &#181;L of 10x capping buffer, 1 &#181;L of 10 mM GTP, 1 &#181;L of 2 mM SAM (freshly diluted) ,and 1 &#181;L of Vaccinia capping enzyme per carrier RNA.</li>\n\t\t<li>Mix up to 10 &#181;g of each carrier molecule in 15 &#181;L of total volume and denature for 10 min at 65 &#176;C. Place on ice immediately to prevent secondary structure formation.</li>\n\t\t<li>Mix the denatured carrier RNA with 5 &#181;L of the capping mix and incubate for 1 h at 37 &#176;C.</li>\n\t\t<li>Purify capped RNA molecules using an RNA purification kit &#8212; follow the manufacturer&#8217;s clean-up protocol. Elute RNA in 30 &#181;L of water. To increase the elution yield, leave the water in the column for 5 min before centrifugation.<br />\n\t\t<strong>NOTE:</strong> Measure concentration using the microvolume spectrophotometer. Expected A260/A280 ratio is &#62;2 and A260/A230 is &#62;2. Note that for some RNA samples A260/A230 may be between 1.3&#8211;2. Expected yield when using 10 &#181;g of uncapped RNA is 9&#8211;10 &#181;g of capped RNA.</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Prepare the mix of the capped and uncapped carrier by combining the amounts described in <strong>Table 3</strong>. Mix well by flicking the tube and measure the concentration using the microvolume spectrophotometer.<br />\n\t<strong>NOTE: </strong>If a higher concentration of the carrier is required to fit in the reverse transcription reaction (see below), the carrier mix can be concentrated using the vacuum concentrator at low-medium temperature (30-35 &#176;C) until reaching the desired final concentration. Steps 2&#8211;14 are modified from the standard nAnT-iCAGE protocol reported by Murata et al.<sup class=\"xref\">11</sup></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"jove_title\">2.

Mix by flicking the tube.<br />\n\t<strong>NOTE:</strong> If the sample RNA is too diluted for reverse transcription (see below), combine it with the appropriate amount of the carrier, concentrate using the vacuum concentrator to 9 &#181;L total volume, and add 1 &#181;L of the RT primer. Adding the carrier earl, to reach 5 &#181;g of RNA in total prevents sample loss.</li>\n\t<li>Heat the mix from step 2.1 at 65 &#176;C for 5 min, and place on ice immediately to prevent renaturation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Prepare of the reverse transcription (RT) mix.</strong>\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li>For each sample combine 6.1 &#181;L of water (RNase- and DNase-free), 7.6 &#181;L of 5x first-strand buffer, 1.9 &#181;L of 0.1 M DTT, 1 &#181;L of 10 mM dNTPs, 7.6 &#181;L of trehalose/sorbitol mix (see recipe in Murata et al.<sup class=\"xref\">11</sup>) and 3.8 &#181;L of the recommended reverse transcriptase (see <strong>Table of Materials</strong>).

Mix until visibly homogenous.</li>\n\t<li>Incubate in a thermal cycler using the following program: 25 &#176;C for 30 s, 50 &#176;C for 60 min, and hold at 4 &#176;C.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Purification of cDNA:RNA hybrids using SPRI magnetic beads</strong>\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li>Add 68.4 &#181;L of the recommended RNAse- and DNase-free SPRI beads (see <strong>Table of Materials</strong>) to 38 &#181;L of the RT mix (beads to sample ratio 1.8:1). Mix well by pipetting and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (RT).</li>\n\t\t<li>Separate the beads on a magnetic stand for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and wash the beads twice with 200 &#181;L of 70% ethanol (freshly prepared).<br />\n\t\t<strong>NOTE:</strong> The ethanol is added to the beads without mixing and while the tube is on the magnetic stand. The added ethanol is immediately removed. Care should be taken not to lose any beads during washes as it may lead to sample loss.</li>\n\t\t<li>While the tube is still on the magnetic stand, remove all traces of ethanol. Droplets of ethanol can be removed and pushed out of the tube using a P10 pipette. Do not let the beads dry.</li>\n\t\t<li>Add 42 &#181;L of water preheated at 37 &#176;C to the beads and elute the sample by pipetting up and down 60x.<br />\n\t\t<strong>NOTE:</strong> Be careful not to cause foaming by pipetting as it may cause loss of beads (i.e<em>.,</em> bound sample) in the foam.</li>\n\t\t<li>Incubate at 37 &#176;C for 5 min without the lid to allow evaporation of trace amounts of ethanol.</li>\n\t\t<li>Separate the beads on a magnetic stand for 5 min and transfer the supernatant to a new plate.<br />\n\t\t<strong>NOTE:</strong> Try to retrieve all the supernatant to prevent sample loss while avoiding bead carryover. Use the P10 pipette to get the last sample droplets.</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"jove_title\">3.
